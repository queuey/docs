## Resources

### Projects

A Project houses the information about a waitlist that associates a website that you create a waitlist for. The project waitlist can be for the whole website, a specific feature or to capture early signups for a new product launch.

For example, if you have a new product you are launching at my-new-cool-product.com, you could call your project `My New Cool Product`.

If you had already launched, and you're thinking about releasing a new feature, but don't want to release it to everyone straight away, you could call it `Cool New Product Feature`.

### Members

[Members](members) are customers who have signed up to your waitlist. They are associated to [projects](projects.md).
